The hello class can handle printing a greeting to the user.

#+BEGIN_SRC php :tangle yes
<?php

class Hello {
  protected $firstName;
  protected $lastName;

#+BEGIN_SRC php :tangle yes

public function __construct (
  $firstName = 'Matthew',
  $lastName = 'Carter',
  $age = 99
) {
  $this->firstName = $firstName;
  $this->lastName = $lastName;
  $this->age = $age;
}
#+END_SRC

** Printing a greeting
This is used to print out the greeting based on what was passed in
previously.

public function doGreeting () {
  echo "Hello {$this->firstName} {$this->lastName}, you are {$this->age} years old!";
}
