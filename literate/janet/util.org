* str
This is a similar interface to Clojure str.

#+begin_src janet :tangle yes
(defn str
  "Join r.. strings into one."
  [& r]
  (string/join r))
#+end_src

* conj
Another similar interface to Clojure's - used to join things together.

#+begin_src janet :tangle yes
(defn concat
  "Clojure like concat."
  [& r]
  (->> (reduce array/concat @[] r)
       (apply tuple)))
#+end_src
